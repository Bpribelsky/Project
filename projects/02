# BACS 200 - Project #2 - Inspiration

## Student Home Page

The purpose of this project is to build a simple page that describes a person that inspires you.

The world can be a dark place, and we all need a little inspiration.  Who inspires you to make
the world a little brighter.  You can pick a historical or public figure or someone that only 
you know.

Describe why they inspire you and what your response is toward them and what they believe in.
Create an article that invites your peers to admire your hero.  Use your persuasion skills to
win others over.  You will be judged based strength of your writing by your peers. 

When you place your page on Bluehost, make sure that it does not damage your WordPress blog.  Place
your HTML files in a directory called "bacs200".  The page you create should be "inspire.html".

Balance both the business requirements and technical requirements.

Make sure that your page uses a HTML template with valid HTML.

Customize this code for a jump start on the HTML.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Page Title</title>

    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>Inspiring Figure</h1>
