# BACS 200 - Project #10 - Business Blog

## Build a Business Blog

The goal of this project is to create a business blog as a tool for establishing professional credibility.  
Over the next four weeks you will write and publish one short article each week on a key business topic.

Employers will want to see you work to evaluate your skill.  This project helps you start the habit of blogging.  
You should write something every week even if it is short.

Use your WordPress blog on Bluehost to publish your content.  Think of a catchy name for your blog. 
It is really easy to change later when you think of a better name.

Write about topics you care about.  Passion sells.

Figure out an area where you want to be a recognized expert.  Start making yourself an expert.

You are entitled to your opinion.  No one can edit what you say on your blog.

Feel the liberation of empowerment!
