<h1>Show Source Code Demo</h1>

<p>
    This demo show how to display HTML source code in a page. Normally the browser will display the effects of
    the HTML instead of the HTML source code. To prevent this you must convert all of the special characters in
    the code into HTML entities.
</p>
<p>
    This is very tedious and time consuming. This demo shows you how to do this with one line of code. Save this
    HTML file content as "source.php". Fix up the file to contain your text. Then move it to your Bluehost server
    since it cannot be tested on your local computer.

    <a href="source.php">See Live Demo</a>

<pre>
    <?php  
        $text = "<h2>Bad Things Happen</h2><ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>";  
        echo htmlspecialchars($text); 
    ?>
</pre>
