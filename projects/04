# BACS 200 - Project #4 - Educate

## Educate Page

The purpose of this project is to build a simple page that tells about your favorite TED talk.

Visit the [TED Talks website](https://www.ted.com/talks) to find a talk that lights your fire.

Write a persuasion piece for your fellow students.  Convince them that they should care about the topic that you choose.

Summarize the talk and add your own thoughts and opinions.  Your article should be about 250 words.  
It will graded on both the business and technical content quality.  In other words, write good 
HTML and present a good logical argument.

The page you create should be "bacs200/educate.html".

Balance both the business requirements and technical requirements.

Make sure that your page uses a HTML template with valid HTML.

Customize this code for a jump start on the HTML.
